## About Me 👋


**Diandra-Sherman/Diandra-Sherman** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.



I am results-driven I.T. Project Management and Business Analyst with 10+ years of technology, delivering exemplary customer success and customer needs, by shaping innovative technology solutions for the various department and ministries throughout The Government of the Bahamas. I'm also adept at applying project management methodologies to streamline processes, reduce or eliminate cost, improve project outcomes with an ever increasing growth mindset and using key performance indicators. I have 17 years as a college lecturer, adopting and utilizing BTVI's digital learning management systems. I lecture in Introduction to Computers (which covers, to name a few: hardware, software, networking, digital life, etc.) and Microcomputer Applications (which covers Microsoft Word, Excel, Access and PowerPoint).

At any given time, I would be leading and managing 15+ projects, with 5 to 8 active ones. Being able to manage multiple projects and customer needs remotely, as the sole PM/BA for The Dept. of Information & Communication Technology (DICT), would make be an excellent fit as a Program Manager. My continued determination makes me a dependable, reliable and purpose-driven manager.
